## Fun Projects

This notebook creates a graphical chart of the sporting activities done by me throughout the year.    

I have used turtle for graphics.   


Activities can be downloaded as per 

https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216918437-Exporting-your-Data-and-Bulk-Export

Use the activities.csv file to run the above code.    

All the 52 weeks are shown as a radius of a circle.   
Red dots indicate a day with no activity and the dot size represent the length of the activity!
